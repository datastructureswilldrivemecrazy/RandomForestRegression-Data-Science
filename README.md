# RandomForestRegression-Data-Science
Using the scikit-learn library, i've made a random forest regression model for a small dataset. This kind of regression works based on the concept of ensemble learning where a certain algorithm is repeated again and again till an optimal result has been reached. I've used numpy, pandas and matplotlib for the resource libraries.

This is the dataset that I've used.

This is the graphical representation after compilation and running the program.
