# RandomForestRegression-Data-Science
Using the scikit-learn library, i've made a random forest regression model for a small dataset. This kind of regression works based on the concept of ensemble learning where a certain algorithm is repeated again and again till an optimal result has been reached. I've used numpy, pandas and matplotlib for the resource libraries.
